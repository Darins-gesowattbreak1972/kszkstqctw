Man, just finished Deva and I am just like... wow. Seriously, dude, it was a roller coaster. My brain is still kind of trying to process what I just watched. You know when you're expecting one thing and it just throws you for a loop? Yeah, it was that kind of trip. 

Half the time I'm sitting there like, Wait, what? and the other half I'm just laughing at how crazy it all is. They really didn't hold back on the drama, lol. It's like they downloaded the movie from a parallel universe where everything's extra intense. And the characters, oh boy, don't even get me started—some of the decisions they make, I swear, it's like they were written by someone high on their own supply of historical textbooks. 

But hey, gotta give them credit for keeping me on my toes. At moments I couldn't decide if I was frustrated or just super invested. You ever have that with a movie? Where you're yelling at the screen but also can't stop watching? That's endorsement, I guess, in some twisted way.

> Honestly though, they'd teach history like this, I'd expect even the most bored students to tune in. Like, you get all the drama of past and present mixed; makes you think, you know? Plus, some of those cinematographic choices were wild. I can't say if they were genius or just plain chaotic, maybe a bit of both. Probably both.

Oh, and the way it ended?? Come on. I won't spoil it, but let's just say it's one of those where you're checking the runtime thinking, Okay, they got 10 mins to wrap this up and then BAM—it just races past leaving you hanging. I definitely need to watch the movie again when I'm not half brain-dead from a long day.

if experience == mind_blowing: movie.rewatch()

Speaking of which, probably should've started earlier instead of procrastinating, but hey, that's me. Anyway, if you haven't seen it, totally worth the chaos. Ready to dissect the madness with you over some coffee next time. Catch ya later!
